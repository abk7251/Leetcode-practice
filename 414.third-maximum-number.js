 * Testcase Example:  '[3,2,1]'
 *
 * Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this
 * array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity
 * must be in O(n).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [3, 2, 1]
 * 
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [1, 2]
 * 
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is
 * returned instead.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]
 * 
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum
 * distinct number.
 * Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
